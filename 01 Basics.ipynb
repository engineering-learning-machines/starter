We either don't know enough about the physical process behind the quantities that we can observe, or the problem is inherently stochastic (e.g. quantum mechanical wave functions). In such cases, we abstract away some of the behavior of the system in a more abstract type of variable, called a `random variable`."

We can imagine the evaluation of the expression $x + Z = ?$ as throwing the die first to obtain a definite value  (called an *outcome*) for $Z$ and then using that value to calculate the result. We can never predict with certainty what that value will be, because the outcomes are generated by the intrinsic stochastisticity of the system (in this case we chose not to care about every single microscopic interaction).

For simple models, we can define the sample space explicitly (e.g. a coin toss has a sample space $S = \\{heads, tails\\}$), but there are also cases where the sample space is infinite, such as the entire set of the real numbers. In terms of notation, the random variable is conventionally denoted by a capital letter (e.g. $X$) when used in a generic expressions and with $X=x$ when we mean that it takes on a concrete value (outcome) $x$."

If we use it in some calculation, the final result will be also random, since `C` will some times be `heads` and some times `tails`: `x + C = 1 + heads or tails`. Although the final concrete value of `C` can not be predicted with absolute certainty, the random variable behaves according to certain rules. For a balanced coin, we expect that the values `C=heads` and `C=tails` to occur with about the same frequency, or 50% of the time. If we toss 100 times, we expect that there will be about 50 `heads` and 50 `tails` and say that the *probability* for event (the values that the random variable *can* take on are called 'events') `tails` to occur is 0.5 and the probability for event `heads` to occur is also 0.5. A probability of 0 means that an event never occurs and a probability of 1 means that an event always occurs (deterministic event).

There can also be random variables with countably infinite events: `{0,1,2,3,...}`.

In this case we don't have discrete events, since no matter how small the 'gap' (interval) between two given events, we can also find another event in between them. We can not produce a tabular representation for such probability distributions, therefore the probbability density function is also continuous and is usually specified analytically. The most fundamental continuous probability distribution is the Gaussian distribution and is defined by the famous \"Bell curve\":"

    "Imagine that you would like to measure the width of a table. Your measuring tape has a limited precision, probably several millimeters. Every time you measure the width, you will record a slightly different result in the best precision you are capable of. The whole process can be abstracted as sampling from the continuous random variable `table width` (there are some other details that we are not going to work out here) and recording a series of events - the measured width values. In many cases we don't want to know the exact shape and distribution of a random variable, but only a simplified representation called a *statistic*. In this case we would like to know the width of the table that we can estimate by averaging all the measured width values (sampled events). \n",
